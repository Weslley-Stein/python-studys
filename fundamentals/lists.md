# Lists
Lists are a data structure which allows you to store multiples pieces of data of multiples types, a list its enumerate by Index, which means
the first element its represented by "0" and then go on
```py
#Creating a List
my_list = ["Weslley", "Zeno", "Sett"]
print(my_list)
#Expected output: Weslley, Zeno, Sett

#Take a specific element of a list
print(my_list[index_of_the_element]) 

#Periods with lists
print(my_list[1:])#That will take every element after the element of index 1(including himself)

#Changing a value of an element of the list
my_list[0] = "Yellsew"
Print(my_list[0])
#Expected Output: Yellsew 
```
