# Input and Output

We can use the function "input()" to receive a input from the user, and the "input()" function can have a placeholder, like this: "input("placeholder")
and we can use the function "print()" to output

### Print
the function print receive three kind of arguments: values, separator and end, what which one does?
- values: variables, lists, strings, numbers, any kind of data
- separator: will dictate what will separate one string from another, normally the separator is " "(space)
- end: will dictate how is the end of the print, the default value is "\n"(new line char)
Ex:
```py
print("pablo","weslley","carla",sep="-",end="END")
#Expected output: pablo-weslley-carlaEND
```
