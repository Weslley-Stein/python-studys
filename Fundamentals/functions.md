# Functions
A function its like a "microprogram" a piece of code with a specific task inside of a bigger code
a function is something like: function(arguments)
### Creating a function on python
```py
#Declaring the function
def my_function():
	#Body of the function, where things are executed
	print("Hello World")
my_function()#Calling the function
#Expected output: "Hello World" 
```

### Variables and Functions
We can access variables of the code inside of a function and even create variables inside of the function
```py
my_name = "Weslley"
def my_function(name):
	print(name)

my_function(my_name)
#Expected output: Weslley
```
