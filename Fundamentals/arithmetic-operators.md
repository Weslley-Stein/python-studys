# Arithmetic Operators
Basically Arithmetic Operators its used to make operations between numbers such as Sum, Difference, Division and Multiplication
- Sum: +
- Difference: -
- Multiplication: *
- Division: /
- Exponentiation: **
- Remainer: %
```py
a = 10
b =  5
print(f'Assume a value is {a} and b value is {b}') 
print(f'Sum of a and b: {a + b}')
print(f'Difference of a and b: {a - b}')
print(f'Multiplication of a and b: {a * b}')
print(f'Division of a and b: {a / b}')
print(f'A elevated to B: {a**b}')
print(f'The remainer of A divided for B is {a%b}')
```
